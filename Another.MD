# Monocular depth estimation and segmentation

This model is to estimate depth maps and also to create masks of the object of interest.

Model building is broken down into the following parts. We will work on the parts and then build the sum.


### Pre model


- [X] - Data ingestion- Dataset and Dataloader

- [ ] - Image augmentation


### Model Training

- [ ] - Model selection

- [ ] - Choose the Loss function

- [ ] - Save the weights!


### Output of the model

- [ ] - How is the output presented

- [ ] - Show data in Tensorboard
